# LAHS Hack Club GET

Any Los Altos High School club can easily get a web presence courtesy of LAHS Hack Club. Get a free lahs.club domain, which you can have redirect to your club's website, Instagram, or another page. It's memorable and great for promoting on social media or on posters! We sponsor a variety of options and support for every club, whether you have a website already or not.

This repository contains the frontend code, built in SvelteKit (Node deployment).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building (Local)

```bash
npm run build
node ./build
```

## Building (Docker)

```bash
docker build -t get .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d get
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
